Project Overview
This repository contains the data and R scripts behind the interactive Shiny application:
https://mazzarine-l-thesis.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/

About the App
The app focuses on botanical data from five botanical gardens located in Switzerland:
Neuch√¢tel, Fribourg, Lausanne, Geneva, and Champex.

Key Features
Phylogenetic Tree Visualization: Displays phylogenetic trees of plant families filtered by one or multiple selected gardens.

Genus Selection Model: Interactive model to select genera to improve phylogenetic family coverage.

Species Coverage Graphs: Visualize species, genus, and family coverage across the selected gardens.

Whittaker Diagrams: Environmental coverage plots illustrating species distribution within gardens.

Rapid Species Search: Quickly check species presence or absence in gardens with an integrated world distribution map.

Sampling Overview: Displays sampled plants in each garden with identifiers, location maps, and progress graphs of sampling efforts.

Data Description
Data cover botanical inventories and sampling records from the five gardens mentioned above.

Multiple datasets include total species lists, sampled subsets, and environmental variables.

Purpose
This tool aims to facilitate the analysis of botanical diversity, species distribution, and sampling coverage within Swiss botanical gardens. It supports research in ecology, conservation, and plant phylogenetics by providing interactive, user-friendly visualizations and data exploration capabilities.
